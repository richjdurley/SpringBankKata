# Acme Stores Smart-Save TDD Exercise (1 hour coding + 20 min Q&A)

Acme Stores a major grocery supermarket in the UK, is building a Smart-Save app that allows an existing loyalty card customer to deposit and withdraw cash from their Smart-Save bank account at the till.  

This allows our customers to “Save as they go”, and for our customers to access cash back from their savings at the till if needed.

Your task as the lead developer in the team is to implement a straw-man solution using Java and TDD implementing the backend API to support the new Smart Save app.  

## Smart-Save API Requirements 

### The functional sprint
Account
- register
- deposit cash
- withdraw cash
- fast balance

Statement query
- Date, transaction type, transaction amount, rolling balance

### Developer Rules
- Must use a strict TDD process
- Must not use abbreviations
- Must apply SOLID principles
- Must keep all objects small, highly cohesive and isolated
- Must use dependency inversion 
- Should use objects in preference to primitives  (e.g. use an Amount object rather than double) 
- Should use lamda programming style where appropriate

### The product owner has given the following acceptance tests for the API

```

Given any request
When_an_invalid_customer_auth_token_is_received()
Then an unauthorized response (status 401) should be returned
```

```
Given a SmartSave account registration request 
When the request contains a valid customerId and customer-auth-token 
Then a new account is created and the accountId of the new account returned.
```

```
Given a newly created SmartSave account
When a second request to create the account is received for the same customer 
Then it should return the existing SmartSave accountId. 
```

```
Given a newly created SmartSave account 
When the opening balance is queried 
Then it should return 0.00
```

```
Given a newly created SmartSave account 
When a deposit of 120.22 is made 
Then the balance should return 120.22
```

```
Given a newly created SmartSave account 
When a withdrawal of 20.22 is requested 
Then a BadRequest exception should be returned stating “Insufficient funds available”
```

```
Given a newly created SmartSave account with a deposit of 20.22 
And a subsequent withdrawal of 10.00GBP 
When the balance is queried 
Then it should return 10.22
```

```
Given a newly created SmartSave account 
When multiple deposits and withdrawals are made in random order 
Then the account balance should be returned correctly
```

### The product owner has given the following acceptance test for statement printing
```
Given a customer makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2019
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2019
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2019
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see
date       || credit     || debit      || balance
14/01/2019 ||            || 500.00     || 2500.00
13/01/2019 || 2000.00    ||            || 3000.00
10/01/2019 || 1000.00    ||            || 1000.00
```
